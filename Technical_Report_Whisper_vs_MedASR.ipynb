    "# Technical Report: Evaluating Whisper vs. MedASR for Dental Consultations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project establishes a comprehensive benchmarking pipeline to evaluate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance within the specialized dental domain. By comparing a high-throughput general-purpose model (OpenAI Whisper via Groq API) against a medically-tuned alternative (Google MedASR), the pipeline assesses clinical safety, regulatory compliance, and semantic integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding**: MedASR demonstrates superior clinical accuracy (79.26% overall) compared to Whisper (70.44% overall), with significantly lower error rates and higher medical terminology accuracy, making it more suitable for clinical deployment.\n",

    "## 1. Overview & Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Context\n",
    "Dental consultations require precise transcription of:\n",
    "- **Medical terminology** (pulpitis, pericoronitis, endodontic, etc.)\n",
    "- **Drug administration** (Lidocaine, Amoxicillin, Clindamycin with dosages)\n",
    "- **Anatomical laterality** (left/right, upper/lower molar identification)\n",
    "- **Negation accuracy** (distinguishing presence vs. absence of symptoms)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "1. Benchmark ASR performance across medical and linguistic dimensions\n",
    "2. Evaluate regulatory compliance (PHI/PII exposure, EHR readiness)\n",
    "3. Establish deployment-ready quality gates for production systems\n",
    "4. Provide actionable recommendations for clinical ASR selection\n"

    "\n",
    "## WHISPER (OpenAI Whisper large-v3-turbo via Groq)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Whisper shows **critical/high-level errors** in medical speech transcription, with particular struggles in:\n",
    "- Medical domain terminology\n",
    "- Numeric/unit precision\n",
    "- Medication names and dosages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Categories in Whisper\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Medical Term Corruption**  CRITICAL\n",
    "- **Error**: Complex medical terms severely misspelled or phonetically corrupted\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"cracked tooth syndrome\" → \"Crack-T Th Muss syndrome\"\n",
    "  - \"irreversible pulpitis\" → \"irreversible pulpitus anderapical\"\n",
    "  - \"apical periodontitis\" → \"erapical periodontitis\"\n",
    "  - \"MOD amalgam\" → \"MD amalgam\"\n",
    "  - \"PDL space\" → \"CBL space\"\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: CRITICAL—Diagnosis and treatment plan misidentified\n",
    "- **Frequency**: Multiple instances across clinical note\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Medication Name Gibberish**  CRITICAL\n",
    "- **Error**: Medication names become unrecognizable nonsense\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"ibuprofen\" → \"I'd be protein\"\n",
    "  - \"lisinopril\" → \"lasthinop乐\" (with mixed Unicode characters)\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: CRITICAL—Medications become unidentifiable\n",
    "- **Clinical Consequence**: Healthcare provider cannot dispense correct medication\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Unit/Dosage Errors**  CRITICAL\n",
    "- **Error**: Milligrams converted to nanograms (1000x difference!), units misrecognized\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"400 mg\" → \"400 ng\" (patient would receive 1/1,000,000 of intended dose)\n",
    "  - \"10 mg\" → \"10 ng\"\n",
    "  - \"6 mm\" → unrecognized\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: CRITICAL—Medication dosing potentially lethal\n",
    "- **Standard**: Should maintain exact unit and numeric precision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Date and Identifier Substitution**\n",
    "- **Error**: Clinical dates and tooth/item identifiers corrupted\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"December 15th\" → \"December 16th\"\n",
    "  - \"tooth number 4\" → \"teenage number 4\"\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: HIGH—Record mismatch, wrong tooth treated\n",
    "- **Clinical Consequence**: Patient confusion, wrong tooth extraction/treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Homophone/Sound Confusion**\n",
    "- **Error**: Similar-sounding words substituted\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"throbbing\" → \"clotting\"\n",
    "  - \"bagel\" → \"basil\"\n",
    "  - \"drank\" → misheard\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: MEDIUM—Symptom description altered\n",
    "- **Example**: \"throbbing pain\" (accurate) vs \"clotting pain\" (incorrect medical interpretation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Phrase/Context Drops**\n",
    "- **Error**: Timeline and frequency data lost\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - \"three days\" → \"two days\"\n",
    "- **Safety Impact**: MEDIUM—Treatment urgency assessment affected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Structural Loss & Punctuation**\n",
    "- **Error**: No markup, inconsistent capitalization, missing clinical structure\n",
    "- **Impact**: MEDIUM—Clinical note unusable without reformatting\n",
