Doctor: Good morning Mark, it’s good to see you again, though I see on the schedule you’re having some trouble today, did you manage to get here okay with the snow starting up? Mark: Morning Doc, yeah the roads aren’t too bad coming down from Concord, just a bit slick on the exit, but honestly I was distracted by this tooth, it’s been driving me up the wall. Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that, let’s take a look, it’s on the upper right side correct? Mark: Yes, right, it feels like maybe the second or third one, the pain is on the back. Doctor: Okay, walk me through the timeline, when did you first notice it? Mark: I think the pain started about two weeks ago when I drank my morning coffee, for the last three days it’s been constant, and last night was tough, I barely slept. Doctor: Was it throbbing or sharp shooting pain? Mark: It started as a deep dull throb and then turned sharp, especially when I tried to bite into a toasted bagel sandwich, the pain was insane. Doctor: Does cold or hot trigger it? Mark: Cold water definitely, even cold air outside sets it off and the pain lasts a minute or two. Doctor: On a scale of one to ten, where is the pain now? Mark: Right now maybe two or three, but earlier this morning it was an eight. Doctor: Have you taken anything? Mark: Yes, my GP suggested ibuprofen, I took 400 mg this morning. Doctor: You’re still taking lisinopril 10 mg daily? Mark: Yes doctor. Doctor: Any changes to your medical history? Mark: No, everything is the same. Doctor: I’ll lean you back and take a look, tell me if this hurts. Mark: Ow, yes, that’s the one. Doctor: I’m applying cold spray, raise your hand when you feel it. Mark: Wow, it lingered for a long time. Doctor: I’ve gathered what I need, I’ll dictate the clinical findings now. Doctor: Start clinical note, patient Mark Dan, date December 15th, tooth number 4 with large MOD amalgam, suspected fracture, positive percussion, lingering cold response over 15 seconds, isolated 6 mm pocket, widened PDL space, diagnosis cracked tooth syndrome with irreversible pulpitis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, end clinical note. Doctor: Okay Mark, we can sit you up. Mark: Is it bad, can it be fixed? Doctor: It’s significant but fixable, the tooth has a crack that allowed bacteria into the nerve, causing irreversible pulpitis. Mark: So what’s the treatment? Doctor: We’ll do root canal therapy to remove the nerve and then place a crown to protect the tooth. Mark: Okay doctor, I can’t handle the pain anymore, let’s do it. Doctor: I’ll prepare the consent form and get you numb, the assistant will discuss the co-pay based on your Delta Dental plan. Mark: Sounds good, thanks a lot Doc. Doctor: You’re welcome, let’s get you comfortable.
